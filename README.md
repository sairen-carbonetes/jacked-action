Jacked provides organizations with a more comprehensive look at their application to take calculated actions and create a better security approach. Its primary purpose is to scan vulnerabilities to implement subsequent risk mitigation measures. 

## Directory Scanning

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2 # repository that will be used for scanning
      - name: Run carbonetes/jacked # runs the github action of jacked
        uses: carbonetes/jacked@v1.0.0 # runs the github action using this version
        with: # userâ€™s input reference for scanning options, results that jacked-action supported.
          fail_on_vulnerability: true # sample output reference: job fails when vulnerability found.
